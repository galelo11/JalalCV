    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="short-about">
        Hello, I'm Jalal, a dedicated accountant with a passion for programming. With a background in both finance and technology, I've found innovative ways to merge these two fields to create a more efficient and accurate accounting process. With over 7 years of experience, I've honed my skills in financial management and software development, delivering results that drive success.
      </p>
    
    <p id="full-about" class="hidden">
      As an accountant, my goal is to ensure the utmost accuracy and transparency in financial records. I recognized that repetitive tasks could be automated, freeing up valuable time for more complex analyses and strategic decision-making. This realization led me to my journey into programming.
      
      Over the years, I've developed customized software solutions tailored to the unique needs of accounting. These programs not only streamline routine tasks but also significantly reduce the risk of human error. By utilizing programming languages such as Python and automation tools, I've successfully created systems that not only save time but also enhance the integrity of financial data.
      
      My experience in both accounting and programming has equipped me with a versatile skill set. I thrive on finding creative solutions to complex financial challenges and implementing them through elegant lines of code. Whether it's developing algorithms to analyze large datasets or crafting applications to reconcile accounts, I am committed to optimizing every aspect of the accounting process.
      
      My journey as an accountant and programmer has shown me that the intersection of these fields is where innovation thrives. I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible and delivering accurate, efficient, and forward-thinking solutions to the financial world.
      
      I'm really skilled at using Microsoft Excel for handling data. I can organize and analyze data effectively, making it easier to understand and use. Excel is my tool for simplifying processes and making smart decisions with accurate information.
