    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="short-about">
        Hello, I'm Jalal, a dedicated accountant with a passion for programming. With a background in both finance and technology, I've found innovative ways to merge these two fields to create a more efficient and accurate accounting process. With over 7 years of experience, I've honed my skills in financial management and software development, delivering results that drive success.
      </p>
    
    <p id="full-about" class="hidden">
      As an accountant, my goal is to ensure the utmost accuracy and transparency in financial records. I recognized that repetitive tasks could be automated, freeing up valuable time for more complex analyses and strategic decision-making. This realization led me to my journey into programming.
      
      Over the years, I've developed customized software solutions tailored to the unique needs of accounting. These programs not only streamline routine tasks but also significantly reduce the risk of human error. By utilizing programming languages such as Python and automation tools, I've successfully created systems that not only save time but also enhance the integrity of financial data.
      
      My experience in both accounting and programming has equipped me with a versatile skill set. I thrive on finding creative solutions to complex financial challenges and implementing them through elegant lines of code. Whether it's developing algorithms to analyze large datasets or crafting applications to reconcile accounts, I am committed to optimizing every aspect of the accounting process.
      
      My journey as an accountant and programmer has shown me that the intersection of these fields is where innovation thrives. I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible and delivering accurate, efficient, and forward-thinking solutions to the financial world.
      
      I'm really skilled at using Microsoft Excel for handling data. I can organize and analyze data effectively, making it easier to understand and use. Excel is my tool for simplifying processes and making smart decisions with accurate information.

                <strong>G-Office Core </strong>
             <u>Program for Office Client Information and Notes Management:</u>
            </div><br>
            <p>I designed and developed a comprehensive software program to efficiently manage and organize crucial client information and notes, enhancing the overall productivity and effectiveness of our office operations. This custom solution offers the following key features and benefits:    </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <u>1. Centralized Data Repository</u> </li>
                <li> <u> 2. Note-taking and Communication</u> </li>
                  <li><u>  3. Customized Categorization</u> </li>
                    <li><u>  4. Search and Retrieva</u> </li>
                      <li><u>  5. Efficiency Gains:</u> The introduction of this program has resulted in substantial efficiency gains, reducing manual administrative tasks, minimizing data entry errors, and streamlining client relationship management processes.</li>

              <strong>G-Banking </strong>
           <u>Cheque Information Management and Integration Program:</u>
          </div><br>
          <p>I conceptualized, developed, and implemented an innovative software program that revolutionized our cheque processing workflow. This comprehensive solution streamlines the entire process, from capturing cheque data to seamless integration with our accounting software. Here's an overview of the program's core functionalities:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><u>1. Digital Imaging:</u> The program goes beyond mere data capture by saving each cheque as a high-quality image on the computer. This visual record ensures transparency and easy retrieval of cheque copies for future reference, audits, or dispute resolution. </li> 
<li><u>2. Supplier Deduction Ratio:</u> I implemented a dynamic deduction ratio check for suppliers. The program intelligently identifies whether a supplier is subject to a deduction ratio, simplifying compliance with supplier agreements and financial regulations.</li>
<li><u>3. Accounting Software Integration:</u> One of the program's standout features is its seamless integration with our accounting software. It maps the supplier's name and number directly to the accounting system, ensuring that cheque data is converted accurately without manual entry. This integration saves significant time and minimizes the risk of transcription errors.</li>
<li><u>4. Efficiency and Accuracy:</u> The program has transformed our cheque processing from a manual, time-consuming task to an automated, error-free process. The integration eliminates repetitive data entry, reduces the likelihood of mistakes, and ensures our accounting records are always up-to-date and precise.</li>
